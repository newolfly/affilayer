# Deployment guide — AffiLayer MVP

Nothing in this repo deploys itself. Every step below is manual and explicit.
No step here has been run against any Cloudflare account, Supabase project, or
GitHub remote.

## 0. Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+, npm 10+
- A Cloudflare account (for Pages + DNS)
- A Supabase project (create at supabase.com — free tier is enough for the MVP)
- A host for the tracking service (any Node host: VPS, Railway, Fly.io, or a
  Cloudflare Worker is **not** suitable — the service is plain Fastify/Node)
- Domain `affilayer.com` (owned; Namecheap) + subdomain `go.affilayer.com`

## 1. Supabase — database first

```bash
cd supabase
# Option A — Supabase CLI (needs `supabase link` first)
supabase db push

# Option B — Dashboard SQL editor, in this exact order:
#   1. migrations/001_schema.sql
#   2. migrations/002_rls.sql
#   3. migrations/003_functions.sql
#   4. migrations/004_seed.sql   (demo data only — skip on a production project)
```

Then verify RLS with `supabase/tests/rls-checks.sql` — run the checks **as a
signed-in app user** (the SQL editor runs as postgres and bypasses RLS, so it
cannot prove the negative cases). See `supabase/README.md`.

Create the first Super Admin: sign up in the app, then in the SQL editor:

```sql
update profiles set role = 'super_admin', status = 'approved'
where email = 'you@example.com';
```

Collect for the web app:

- Project URL → `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- Anon/public key → `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Never** use the service-role key in the browser. It is only for
  server-side jobs (none in the MVP).

## 2. Tracking service — `go.affilayer.com`

```bash
cd services/tracking
npm install
npm run build
```

Environment on the host:

```bash
PORT=3001
TRACKING_BASE_URL=https://go.affilayer.com
POSTBACK_SECRET=<long random secret — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...   # optional; without it the service uses the
                                 # in-memory store (data lost on restart)
```

Start: `npm start` (or `node dist/index.js`). Put it behind HTTPS and point
the DNS record at it:

| Type | Name | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A / CNAME | `go` | your tracking host |

Verify live:

```bash
curl https://go.affilayer.com/health
# {"ok":true}
curl -i "https://go.affilayer.com/c/AFF123/offer-a?sub1=test"
# 302 → landing URL with ?click_id=clk_...
```

Give `POSTBACK_SECRET` to advertisers (securely, out of band) — they sign
conversion posts with HMAC-SHA256 over the raw JSON body, header
`x-affilayer-signature`. Rotate by setting a new value and restarting.

## 3. Web app — Cloudflare Pages

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run build        # produces dist/
```

Deploy (one of):

```bash
# A — Wrangler (needs `npx wrangler login` first)
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name affilayer-web

# B — Dashboard: Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → connect the GitHub repo,
#     build command `npm run build`, output directory `apps/web/dist`,
#     root directory `apps/web`.
```

Pages environment variables (dashboard → Settings → Environment variables):

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | your Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | your Supabase anon key |
| `VITE_TRACKING_URL` | `https://go.affilayer.com` |

Then add the custom domain in Pages → Custom domains: `affilayer.com`
(and `www.affilayer.com` if wanted) and follow Cloudflare's DNS prompts.
The apex domain currently has no Pages project attached — this deploy creates it.

## 4. DNS summary (Cloudflare)

| Record | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `affilayer.com` → Pages | Web app |
| `go.affilayer.com` → tracking host | Tracking service |

## 5. GitHub — version control

```bash
cd affilayer
git init
git add .
git commit -m "AffiLayer MVP: web + tracking + shared + Supabase"
# Create the repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/affilayer.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

`.env` files and `node_modules/` are git-ignored. Never commit
`POSTBACK_SECRET`, Supabase keys, or any real credential.

## 6. Post-deploy checklist

- [ ] Migrations applied; RLS checks run as a real signed-in user
- [ ] Super Admin created and approved
- [ ] Tracking `/health` returns 200 on `go.affilayer.com`
- [ ] A test click + signed test conversion flows end-to-end (see README)
- [ ] Pages site loads with real Supabase env (no demo banner)
- [ ] `POSTBACK_SECRET` shared with the first advertiser out of band
- [ ] Demo seed data removed/not applied on the production project

## 7. Troubleshooting

- Web shows the "Demo data" banner → `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  are missing in the Pages env (rebuild/redeploy after setting them — Vite
  inlines env at build time).
- Tracking 302s to the wrong landing page → offer not in the store; check the
  offer exists and is `active` (demo offers only exist in-memory).
- Conversion 400 `invalid signature` → the advertiser must HMAC the **raw**
  request body bytes, not a re-serialized object.
- Duplicate conversions → expected: same `idempotency_key` or same
  `click_id`+`offer_id` returns the original with `duplicate: true`.
- This VM's Chromium cannot reach public sites (sandbox egress limit) — the
  local Playwright-style checks are not part of this repo; the tracking smoke
  test uses `fastify.inject`, not a real browser.
